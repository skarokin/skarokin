### about
---
I'm 20 years old, pursuing a bachelor's in CS, and am located in the New York metropolitan area. I'm mainly interested in ML engineering, but am also exploring systems programming.
- I'm currently working on a customizable, multi-language grammar checker using spaCy. Inspired by [this research paper](https://mmozgovoy.dev/papers/mozgovoy11b.pdf)
- I plan to read 'Modern Compiler Implementation in Java' over this summer and track my progress

###### stuff
- All of my notes (including math) are typed and meticulously formatted. I have a private repo for this that I'll make public when I graduate
- I'm native Korean and have been learning Japanese for 3 years
- I'm an IGL and coach for Valorant and Overwatch 2 teams (coached R6S in the past)

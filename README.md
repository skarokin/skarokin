### about
I'm a 20 year old CS student located in the NYC metropolitan area, mainly interested in ML engineering.
- Currently building a customizable, multi-language grammar checker with spaCy. Inspired by [this paper](https://mmozgovoy.dev/papers/mozgovoy11b.pdf)
- Plan to read 'Modern Compiler Implementation in Java' over this summer and track my progress
